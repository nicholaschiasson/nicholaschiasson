<details>

  <summary><h4>About Me (Verbose)</h4></summary>

  My name is Nicholas Omer Chiasson. Here and there I may go by Nick, Nicky C, Nicky Bicky, Sticholas, Bix, or even Baby Calves, among other aliases.

  Professionally, I build, evolve, and maintain microservices in a complex web API platform striving to enrich the online experience of the games industry.

  Outside of work, the projects I tend to work on admittedly produce next to no practical value aside from providing me with excuses to continue learning and developing my skills.

  You might say I love to work on pointless projects, but the truth is that the only ideas I ever come up with that spark my passion simply are not million dollar ideas. If I get an idea that interests me, I run with it. Most of the time, it's a dumb idea.

  In spite of that, I try to embrace the philosophy that it's better to embark on a journey with no prize at the end than to do nothing at all.

  In the end, I like to keep things light hearted, as you can perhaps tell by my overly verbose and casual writing style for which I have ignored advice suggesting against publishing on the open internet for all to bear witness to. Above all, I am seeking chances to grow and build.

### What I Do

#### Projects

üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø I had a problem with the English language. [So I changed it](https://github.com/nicholaschiasson/inglix).

üåê I'm revamping [my personal website](https://nicholaschiasson.github.io) now. It's in desperate need of a facelift.

Frankly, I don't have much more to boast about. Come back later and maybe I will.

#### Skills

I work with these. Some more than others. Java is on the tail of the list for a reason.

### What I Like

ü¶Ä Amateur as I am, I am very enthusiastic about the [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/) programming language.

I am trying to build up my skills with various rust frameworks such as [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine) for game development as well as [Actix](https://github.com/actix) and [Yew](https://github.com/yewstack) for web.

üêç I really enjoy [Python](https://www.python.org) for writing short programs very quickly.

Though I used python extensively in school, I have never used it professionally.

:computer: I use [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium) when I'm feeling lazy (most of the time lol), and [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty), [Zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org), [Nushell](https://github.com/nushell), and [Helix](https://github.com/helix-editor) when I'm not.

### The Numbers Don't Lie

üìà Below are some stats derived from my GitHub activity. They are nothing to be too proud of. I hope to improve upon them with time.

Concretely, I'm working on getting more contributions on open source projects that I am not the owner of, and bringing _Rust_ to the top of that most used languages list!
